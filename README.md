# Consonantal Alphabet - Decomposition

This small Python project demonstrates a **Tkinter GUI** that removes all vowels from a given text.  
It was inspired by a university assignment about **consonantal alphabets**, such as the Phoenician writing system, where texts are written without vowels.

## Features
- Text input via an Entry field
- Removes all vowels (both uppercase and lowercase)
- Shows the result with a single click
- GUI with structured layout (Label + Entry + Button + Result)
- Example/demo text included: "Hey! This is my first public project"

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aminatre/consonantal-alphabet.git
```
2. Navigate into the project folder:
```bash
cd consonantal-alphabet
```


3. Run the script:
```bash
